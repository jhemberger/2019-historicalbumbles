# Historical agriculture and bumble bee abundance/community shifts

This study utilizes USDA/Census ag data in tandem with museum records of _Bombus_ spp. to understand long-term shifts in the relative abundance and diversity of bumble bees in relation to historical, areal agricultural activity.

## Study Motivation

A number of bumble bee species have experienced precipitous declines over the past two decades.  While the declines are well documented, explanations for their decline are often speculative, at best.  This study examines historical changes in bumble bee community composition and relative species abundances as a function of agricultural development across the US.  While correlative, these methods might provide additional support for bumble bee decline hypotheses.
