_B. affinis_
- Probability of occurrence increases over time
- Proportion agriculture better as time goes on
- Especially with increasing crop diversity

_B. pensylvanicus_
- Increasing sensitivity to increasing agriculture over time.
  - More ag is good in late 19th and early 20th century
- Generally higher occurrence in areas with fewer crops in those time periods

_B. terricola_
- Strong negative response to increasing proportion cropland, but less so recently (may be artifact of BBW)
- Recent trends largely driven by an increase in collection effort.

_B. bimaculatus_
- Lessening sensitivity to ag over time.
- Increasing crop diversity good late century and beyond

_B. griseocollis_
- No general trend with increasing proportion ag, execpt during recent time periods
- Better in high ag, low richness areas now

_B. impatiens_
- Formerly high occurrence in areas with large ag extent and low crop diversity (similar to pensyl.). Now, only high occurrence in high ag provided there is higher diversity of crops.
