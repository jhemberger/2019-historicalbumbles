abstract: |
  The decline of North American bumble bees has been hypothesized to be due to changes in agricultural practices over the last century.  A switch from diverse and less intensive agricultural systems of the early 1900’s to the largely monocultural, heavy-input systems of today is believed to have impacted both nesting habitat and floral resource availability with negative consequences for bumble bee populations and communities. Despite several analyses of long-term population trends, no studies have yet explicitly linked metrics of agricultural intensification to bumble bee populations. Using spatially widespread and temporally extensive long term sets of both bumble bee and US agricultural census records, we show that metrics of agricultural intensity, specifically an increase in the proportion of cropland and insecticides as well as a decrease in crop richness and the amount of pasture, are associated with the decline of nearly half of bumble bee species in the North Central USA. Additionally, we document positive associations between species and crop richness and additional metrics such as proportion pasture even in areas where agriculture is spatially expansive, suggesting that bumble bee declines are linked not only to the extent of agriculture, but also to the types of agricultural practices implemented.  These findings suggest that agriculture can be made compatible with bee conservation with increased diversification of farms and landscape-level cropping systems that increase diversity of crops, include pasture, and decrease insecticide use.

# Significance statement
Modern agricultural expansion and management have been implicated in recently documented declines of insects and pollinators specifically.  However, until now a lack of historical data on the relationship between agricultural land use change and important pollinator taxa, such as bumble bees, have limited our ability to test the role that agriculture may play in pollinator declines over time. We used 130 years of bumble bee and agricultural census records to show that agricultural intensification, including the extent of agricultural land, diversity of crops, as well as management practices implemented on the ground, are key predictors of bumble bee fate in our landscapes. Knowing these drivers can help develop mitigation strategies to benefit declining bumble bee species. (116 words)

# Introduction
Agriculture is a primary way in which humans alter terrestrial landscapes and is cited as a principle cause of biodiversity declines worldwide [@Foley2005a; @Foley2011b; @Klein2007g; @Tilman2011; @Tscharntke2012]. In particular, the intensification of agriculture, that is, the widespread planting of crop monocultures managed for high productivity with the assistances of fertilizer and pesticides, and high disturbance agronomic practices such as tillage, has been associated with the extensive loss of a number of ecosystem service providing taxa [@Benton2002; @Robinson2002; @Meehan2010a]. There is circumstantial evidence that agricultural practices are driving recently documented, large-scale decline of insects [@Hallmann2017; @Seibold2019]. Pollinating insects, specifically bees, have been particularly hard-hit, sounding an alarm among conservationists across the world [@Steffan-Dewenter2005c; @Tylianakis2013a].

Bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus) are a well-studied bee taxa that have many species documented to be declining across Europe and North/South America [@Biesmeijer2006; @Colla2008; @Grixti2009; @Cameron2011; @Bartomeus2013; @Morales2013; @Wood2019]. Studies point to agricultural intensification as a key driver of bumble bee population decline [@Grixti2009; @Goulson2015c]. Intensification includes both attributes within a farming system (i.e., pesticide use, number and types of crops used), and the effects on agricultural landscapes (i.e., amount of land in cultivation). Despite the suspected threat of agricultural intensification on bumble bees, no studies have yet tied long-term patterns of agriculture to bumble bees. This is due to a paucity of long-term data of both bumble bee occurrence and historical agricultural patterns at large spatial scales.

While contemporary studies examining bumble bee responses to agriculture provide some insights, historical data from archives such as museum records, are important tools to explore patterns of bumble bee change over the course of decades, and offer insights of drivers at temporal and spatial scales that elude detailed, small-scale experimental approaches [@Meehan2011]. The continued addition of records to repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) combined with modern, extensive surveys of bumble bee fauna (e.g., Bumble Bee Watch, iNaturalist) offer widespread, species-specific spatial distribution patterns. Moreover, analyses of records from such repositories have benefited from statistical approaches that account for known biases in archival data [@Pearce2006; @Bartomeus2013; @Bartomeus2019].

In addition, new digital compilations describing agricultural production trends in the United States (Crossley et al. _in review_) permit multi-species exploration of the drivers of change for bumble bee populations. Such data allow a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that long-term historical changes in agricultural intensification across large regions are key determinants of the spatial occurrence and negative temporal trends of bumble bee species. To test this hypothesis, we explored the relationships between long-term bumble bee population trends and historical patterns of agricultural intensification in the North Central USA using an extensive data set of historical bumble bee museum records, modern citizen-science surveys and a dataset of agronomic metrics recently digitized from United States Census of Agriculture over the period 1870-2018. Specifically, we predicted that increasing amounts of proportion cropland and cropland treated with insecticides would be negatively associated with bumble bee relative abundance, while an increase in crop richness and proportion pasture and cover crops would be positively associated with bumble bee relative abundance.

# Methods
We focused our study in the USA on the North Central states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana as these states share a similar biogeographic contexts and agricultural history. We limited our analysis to bumble bee species whose core ranges overlapped these states [@Williams2014], including: _B. affinis_ Cresson; _B. impatiens_ Cresson; _B. griseocollis_ DeGeer; _B. bimaculatus_ Cresson; _B. auricomus_ Robertson; _B. ternarius_ Say; _B. vagans_ Smith; _B. borealis_ Kirby; _B. citrinus_ Smith; _B. pensylvanicus_ De Geer; _B. fervidus_ Fabricius; _B. rufocinctus_ Cresson; and _B. terricola_ Kirby. Four species, _B. fraternus_, _B. perplexus_, _B. ashtoni_ (bohemicus), and _B. variabilis_, were not included in our analyses as they lacked sufficient records to meaningfully interpret changes in relative abundance and county occupancy over time. Of the study species, three (_B. affinis_, _B. terricola_ and _B. pensylvanicus_) are known to be in decline nationally and are of conservation concern [IUCN Red List; @Colla2008; @Jacobson2018a].

## Bumble bee record data
We obtained bumble bee records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), querying for all records within our study region. These data were combined with records from the North American Bumble Bee Watch program (www.bumblebeewatch.org) provided by the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. In total, 25,271 records were compiled from GBIF from 1877 to 2017 and 2,611 from Bumble Bee Watch from 2007 to 2018 for a total of 27,882 unique records over 358 of 535 total counties in the study region (Fig. S1). The species contained in each dataset were mutually inclusive. We then filtered records to include only those which were appropriately geo-referenced (i.e., had associated longitude and latitude). Each record was assigned to a county based on its collection coordinates so that they could be matched to county-level agricultural census data. Because 95% of records were from 1890 and beyond, we are confident that county assignments are accurate, as changes in county geographic extent in this region were largely complete by 1890 (Crossley et al. _in review_).

Temporal comparisons of museum and incidental records can be problematic due to non-standardized collection techniques as well as collector and spatial biases [@Bartomeus2013; @Richardson2018; @Bartomeus2019]. To account for this, we analyzed records using a variety of techniques to control for potential biases. We filtered the dataset to include only single individual ‘sampling events’ (unique combination of species, date, location, and collector), following @Richardson2018. All analyses presented below were conducted using both the full and reduced datasets. Filtering did not impact our conclusions (Appendix 1), and thus we present results from the full dataset.

## Calculating bumble bee relative abundance
In order to estimate changes in bumble bee populations over time, we calculated the relative abundance of each species within each county by agricultural census year. Bumble bee records were binned with the closest agricultural census year (see section Pairing bumble bee records with historical agriculture dataset below), and we divided the total number of records of a given species by the total number of records for all species within each county-by-census year combination. We only calculated relative abundance where species were (i.e., no pseudo-absences were used). Additionally, we limited our analysis to only include county-by-year combinations with greater than 5 total bumble bee records to eliminate the presence of counties with limited sampling effort and where low numbers may artificially inflate the relative abundance of given species.

## Estimating change in county occupancy
Changes in relative abundance may not fully capture declines if species remain stable in relative abundance in occupied counties while the number of occupied counties decreases over time. In this analysis, we used the approach of @Bartomeus2013 and created temporal bins of records such that there were approximately the same number of bee observations per temporal bin using the `rbin` package. We created several binning strategies to determine if the number of bins affected our results [@Bartomeus2013], including a total of 5, 8, and 15 temporal bins. To account for changes in county-level occupancy (i.e., a proxy for the species range), we modeled the number of occupied counties per equal-record temporal bin for each study species using a generalized linear model, predicting number of counties as a function of the temporal bin.

## Calculating temporal patterns of diversity
In order to estimate species richness changes over time, we rarefied records to generate estimates of mean species richness for each equal-record temporal bins with 95% confidence intervals using the `iNEXT` package [@Hsieh2016]. We then fit a linear model to determine the change in species richness over time. Because each time bin contained a different number of years, we used the midpoint of each bin as the value from which to construct the model. We also conducted a permutation test to determine a p-value for the relationship, as the assumption of normally distributed data for such a small sample (e.g., n=5 bins) may be violated. Using the maximum number of permutations (given the number of bin time points), we randomly shuffled the temporal bin order, calculating the correlation between bin and species richness estimates in each permutation, with the p-value equaling the fraction of permuted correlation coefficients greater or less than the true chronological correlation coefficient. Estimated species diversity trends were consistent regardless of the number of bins, however p-values varied with number of bins (marginally significant and significant trend for 8 and 15, respectively, but not for 5). We present results from the 15-bin analyses for estimation of species richness over time in order to portray the highest resolution of the estimated species richness pattern.

## Historical agricultural data
To assess the extent, diversity, and intensity of agriculture, we used county-level agricultural census data projected and geographically corrected by Crossley et al. (in review). Our objective was to estimate county-level (n=535 counties) agricultural metrics, which included aspects of both extensive and intensive farming practices. We limited our metric calculations to the 18 most common crops which together represent over 95% of cropland area study region. For each county by census year, we calculated crop richness (range 0-18) and the proportion of county area in cropland (range 0-1) as our metrics of agricultural intensity.

From 1982 onward, the Census of Agriculture also collected data for additional aspects of agricultural management that are hypothesized to influence bumble bees. These included the proportion of land in a county in pasture and cover crops, as well as proportion of cropland treated with insecticides [@Meehan2011; @Meehan2015; @Meehan2016a].  We extracted these variables from the database, but used them in a separate analysis for this more recent period (see statistical analysis section below).

## Pairing bumble bee records with historical agriculture dataset
Because agricultural census data are collected every 10 years, not every bumble bee record was collected in a year coinciding with an agricultural census. Accordingly, we pooled bee records such that they were within ± 5 years of the nearest agricultural census date (e.g., bumble bee records from 1926-1935 were paired with the 1930 Census of Agriculture data). While this pairing may not perfectly reflect the state of agriculture experienced by collected bumble bees, we posit that it is still meaningful given that large, county-level changes in agricultural practices occurring over several decades are unlikely to manifest in time spans less than five years. To verify this assumption, we performed additional analyses with a stricter ± 2-year pairing rule (i.e., dropping bee data from years beyond these windows) and found similar results (Appendix 2). We thus present the analysis with the full dataset and ± 5-year pairing.

## Relating changes in bumble bee relative abundance to agricultural intensity
We constructed statistical models to examine whether changes in metrics of agricultural intensification were related to bumble bee relative abundance. For each bumble bee species, we fit a generalized linear model with a binomial error structure to predict county-level relative abundance (for a given agricultural census year, number of records of a given species divided by total number of bumble bee records) as a function of (1) number of crops grown within a county, (2) the proportion of county area in agriculture, and (3) the year of the agricultural census data associated with that bumble bee record.  This allowed us to determine a temporal trend in species relative abundance while taking into account variation in agricultural intensification. Observations were weighted by the number of bumble bee records in a county by agricultural census year, effectively giving more weight to counties that had greater sampling intensity. We assumed that these counties provided more accurate estimates of species relative abundance at any given time.

Because of the spatial nature of these data, we tested for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. As the structure of each species GLM model above contains the same counties from multiple agricultural census years, testing for spatial autocorrelation on the entire model is misleading as only spatial autocorrelation within a given agricultural census year may be problematic. As such, we used the agricultural census time period with the greatest number of records for a given species to test for spatial autocorrelation. For each species, we constructed a generalized linear model fitting relative abundance as a function of proportion cropland and number of crops as described above. We then tested model residuals for spatial autocorrelation using a Moran’s I test in the `spdep` package [similar to @Meehan2011; and @Meehan2015] using a p-value of 0.05 at the critical threshold. Of the 13 study species, _B. affinis_, _B. griseocollis_, and _B. impatiens_ showed significant spatial autocorrelation. To account for this, we fit spatial error models for these three species using the `spdep` package and used the GLM framework for the remaining species.

We also tested for temporal autocorrelation within the residual response of each species in models from the entire span of the dataset from 1870-2018. For each species model, we visually examined residuals plots and residual lag correlation values using the `acf` function in R. No species showed temporal autocorrelation across the range of the dataset, as such we did not incorporate any temporal autocorrelation structure to our models.

To illustrate the estimated change in relative abundance and range, we used our fitted models from 1870-2018 to predict species occurrence across our study area using county-level agricultural intensification metrics. These maps describe the predicted probability of occurrence in each county as function of crop diversity and proportion of a county in cropland. We selected 6 roughly equally spaced time points that spanned the length of our dataset (1870, 1900, 1930, 1959, 1974, and 2012) for which we used fitted models to generate predictions. These maps help to depict how county-level agricultural suitability for bumble bees has changed over time.

Another series of models were constructed adding the additional hypothesized drivers of bumble bee relative abundance that were available for the period after 1982. Generalized linear models with a binomial error structure were fit to predict county-level species relative abundance as a function of the proportion of county in pasture, proportion of county in cover crops, proportion of county treated with insecticides, and the agricultural census year. By adding additional putative drivers to our original model, we were able to see if the response of the proportion cropland and crop richness remained consistent given additional drivers that may be collinear. Because the additional variables are known to be correlated to proportion cropland and crop richness, we examined variance inflation factors (VIF) for each model and removed proportion cropland from models due to high multicollinearity (VIF > 10 in several models). All data cleanup, analyses, and plots were conducted in R [Version 3.4.6, @R].

# Results
## Changes in agricultural intensification
From the onset of land-use records in the 1870s, agricultural landcover increased rapidly and began to plateau by the 1910-20s. The areal extent of cropland peaked in the study region in 1950 (45% ± 22% of county area). Since then, it has decreased almost 10% to an average of 34% ± 20% in 2012 (Fig. 1A,B).  There are within-region differences in agricultural cover with northern areas of the study region remaining relatively sparse, while the highest intensity of agricultural cover occurs in the “corn belt” that stretches through southern Minnesota, Iowa, southern Wisconsin, central and northern Illinois, and northern Indiana. Of the 18 crops for which we compiled data (Crossley et al. _in review_), an average of 12 ± 1 were grown per county from 1880 – 1950. Since 1950, this number has declined 50%, with counties today growing on average 6 ± 1 crops (Fig. 1 C,D).

The additional agricultural intensification variables we utilized showed diverging patterns, with proportion of pasture declining 90% from 1982 to present from an average of 3% of county area in 1982 to 0.3% in 2012, while the proportion of total county area treated with insecticides increased 54% from an average of 11% of county area in 1982 to 17% in 2012. (Fig. S4).  Cover crops increased 430% from an average of 0.5% in 1982 to 2.6% in 2012. These changes occurred over similar spatial extents, primarily concentrated in the corn-belt counties throughout the middle of the study region.
Decline of species richness and spatial extent of at-risk bumble bees

## Species richness has declined
Rarefied species richness estimates declined significantly over the last 130 years; 20% over the study period from approximately 15 to 12 species from 1824-1925 to present, respectively (Fig. 2, t~1,13~ = 6.084, p = 0.0283). All fifteen temporal bin species accumulation curves rapidly reached an asymptote, indicating that sample sizes were sufficient to capture bumble bee community diversity within each bin (Fig. S2). A sharp drop in estimated species richness occurred between 1952 and 1959, followed by a slight rebound in the next 50 years. This pattern of decreasing species richness persisted even with aggregation of data into larger time bins (Fig. S3).

## Change in county occupancy varies by species
Over the last 130 years, the fraction of counties in which species were found, as a proxy of spatial extent of a species distribution, varied with 4 species increasing in occupancy over time, 5 stable, and 4 declining (Fig. 3). Notably, all species that are currently of conservation concern showed decreases in the number of counties in which they were found over time, despite an increase in sampling effort during the more recent time periods. Similarly, when we used county-level agricultural statistics to predict the probability of species occurrence, we saw a marked expansion of common species in space (e.g., _B. impatiens_, _B. bimaculatus_), whereas probability of occupancy decreased across the region for many species, especially those of conservation concern (e.g., _B. terricola_, _B. affinis_, _B. pensylvanicus_, Fig. 4, Fig. S5).

## Patterns of bumble bee relative abundance are related to agricultural intensity
In addition to spatial extent, the relative abundance of species has also changed markedly over time. Overall, we found that 7 of 13 species decreased in relative abundance, while 4 remained stable and 2 increased over the study period (Fig. 5A, Table S1, Fig. S5).

Patterns in bumble bee relative abundance showed strong associations with agricultural intensification metrics. A larger amount of cropland in a county, after accounting for changes in bee relative abundance over time, was associated with a decrease in relative abundance 6 species and an increase in 5 species showed a positive association with increasing agriculture (Fig. 5B).  Among species whose relative abundance decline from 1870-2018, the proportion of county in agriculture was negatively associated with relative abundance in 4 species. The strongest decline in relative abundance associated with proportion of cropland was for _B. terricola_.

In contrast, increasing crop species richness within a county was associated with an increase in bumble bee relative abundance of 4 species, while 3 species decreased in abundance. The responses of declining species to crop richness was mixed, with 1 decreasing, 1 increasing, and 5 remaining stable in relative abundance as crop richness increased (Fig. 5C).  The relative abundance of one declining species, _B. fervidus_, was negatively related to all crop metrics.

For more recent years (1982-2018) when additional agricultural data were available, we found that the extent of pasture, cover crops, and use of insecticides were also related to bumble bee relative abundance (Fig. 6B-E, Table S2).  For cover crops, the relative abundance of 3 species increased, 3 decreased, and 7 remained stable as cover crop amount increased (Fig. 6C). Of the 2 species (_B. terricola_ and _B. pensylvanicus_) whose relative abundance declined from 1982-2018, both were species of conservation concern and found in higher relative abundance in counties with more cover crops.

Bumble bee relative abundance increased for 4 species in as the proportion of pasture increased (Fig. 6D, Table S2), although the proportion of pasture per county has markedly decreased over the last century (Fig. S4). The remaining 9 species remained stable in response to proportion pasture. Importantly, the relative abundance of _B. terricola_ had a strong positive association with increased proportion of pasture.

As the proportion of a county treated with insecticides increased, the relative abundance of 4 species decreased (Fig. 6E, Table S2). An additional 4 species increased in relative abundance, while the remaining 5 remained stable as insecticide use increased. Importantly, _B. terricola_ showed the strongest decline in relative abundance in response to increasing insecticide treatment.

# Discussion
Using bumble bee observations recorded over 140 years across 6 north-central US states and an novel dataset on the historical patterns of agricultural land use and practices (extent of cropland, diversity of crops grown, extent of pasture, pesticide use), we explored the hypothesis that agricultural intensification is associated with bumble bee declines. Our results support existing evidence of bumble bee declines throughout the US and suggest that increases in agricultural intensification may favor a select few species at the expense of others.

In contrast to recent studies [e.g., @Dornelas2019], our analyses did not reveal a balance in the number of increasing and decreasing bumble bee species. Of the 13 species analyzed, only 2 were found to increase over the study dataset (1870-2017), while 4 remained at similar levels, and 7 were found to have declined significantly in relative abundance. The declining species in our study match those found to be in decline elsewhere, including in individual state analyses within our study region [@Grixti2009; @Wood2019], the US East coast [@Richardson2018; @Jacobson2018a], Canada [@Colla2008], and North America, generally [@Cameron2011; @Colla2012]. A few species are of particular concern (e.g., _B. terricola_ and _B. pensylvanicus_), both of which we observed decline significantly in relative abundance and range extent over the study period. The patterns of these species of concern match other studies [@Jacobson2018a; @Wood2019] and suggest that protection efforts are urgently needed.

Our results suggest that the extent of agricultural cultivation (i.e., proportion cropland) is not the sole predictor of the fate of bumble bee species: the manner and pattern in which agriculture is practiced is key. With few exceptions, species whose relative abundance was found to be increasing or stable had either positive or neutral relationships with agricultural intensity metrics, while those in decline were negatively associated with increased agricultural intensity.  That is, some species (e.g, _B. impatiens_) thrive in areas and/or times of intense cultivation, while others (e.g., _B. terricola_) struggle.  Additionally, the land-use type (e.g., pasture) and an increased diversity of crops generally had positive relationship with bumble bee relative abundance - especially for species of concern - while inputs such as insecticides yielded positive relationships with only three species.

Given this, landscapes with a high areal extent of agriculture may still support both common and declining bumble bee species provided there is a high diversity of crops, perennial features such as pasture, and limited insecticide use. @Sirami2019 found a similar pattern for farmland biodiversity writ large: increasing the diversity of crops and decreasing field size had a large, positive effect on indices of biodiversity. Our results provide additional evidence that agricultural landscape heterogeneity is key to supporting farmland biodiversity [@Benton2003; @Fahrig2011b].

An increase in proportion of agriculture and reduction crop richness may not be the direct causal factors, but rather the consequences of these practices on the ground may indirectly impact bumble bees.  For example, agricultural intensification reduces diverse, landscape-scale floral habitat such as tall-grass prairies @Smith1998; @Brown2011] and bumble bee forage plants [@Carvell2006b; @Scheper2014], as well as increases insecticide use [@Meehan2011; @Meehan2015]. A shift from the diverse cropping systems of the early to mid 1900's to largely monocultural systems in recent years has also altered the temporal continuity of available floral resources [@Schellhorn2015c; @Timberlake2019a] and total pollen availability, which has been shown to negatively impact bumble bee colony development [@Hass2018a]. Some mass-flowering monocultures might benefit bumble bee colony growth [@Westphal2009a], possibly sustaining species that can tolerate highly variable temporal resources [@Schmid-Hempel1998a; @Hemberger2020], however they provide little dietary diversity for foraging bees. Such a limit on pollen and nectar diversity may have adverse consequences for bumble bee health [@Vaudo2015], especially those species with a limited diet breadth [@Kleijn2008; @Wood2019]. Lastly, landscapes that restrict floral resource availability during key demographic periods might limit bumble bee colony growth [@Williams2012b] and subsequent queen production [@Crone2016], reducing population stability over time.

Contrary to other longitudinal studies [@Colla2012; @Richardson2018], we found no evidence of decline in the relative abundance of the federally endangered _B. affinis_ across our study region, however county occupancy, here a proxy for range, did decline significantly. Additionally, when examining patterns of _B. affinis_ decline across its entire range, there is clear evidence for extensive range reductions and local extirpations [@Cameron2011; @Colla2012; @Wood2019]. Indeed, the subset of the range observed in our study has the most extensive modern records of _B. affinis_, suggesting that our observed regional patterns may differ from range-wide population trends.  Given this, it is important to note that examining temporal patterns in relative abundance necessitates that as one species relative abundance increases, others must decrease.  Relative abundance cannot capture declines in absolute abundance, which may also be occurring simultaneously.

Care must be taken to account for biases associated with historical collections. For example, museum collection records do not necessarily adhere to standard ecological practices of ensuring random, equal-effort samples over adequate space and time [@Richardson2018]. To account for known issues, we employed a variety of techniques including subsampling and sensitivity analyses to determine whether our chosen methods skewed results [for a thorough analysis of techniques to leverage historical collections, see @Bartomeus2019]. Irrespective of the approaches used, we consistently identified declines in over half of study species with clear associations to metrics of agricultural intensity.

While there is much contemporary evidence for the consequences of agricultural intensification on bumble bee communities, other variables may also be driving the observed shifts in abundance and occupancy. For example, climate change has reduced bumble bee ranges in both North America and Europe [@Kerr2015]. In their analysis, @Soroye2020 found that climate impacted bumble bee occupancy, however land-use driven occupancy changes were independent from climate effects. That is to say that while climate may be driving large-scale range shifts, land-use still has strong, negative effects on bumble bee occupancy – an effect that we show strong evidence for here.

The scale and intensity of agricultural intensification over the last century is unprecedented and the risks to bumble bees clear, however it is important to place the observed changes in relative abundance and county occupancy into a larger context. Examining changes from 1870 to present day may not accurately capture the pre-European settlement baseline of the study species examined. By 1870, many counties were already extensively altered by both agriculture and deforestation [@Rhemtulla2007a]. In some cases (e.g., Michigan), these alterations may have provided more floral resources by creating open habitat, resulting in the increase of some bumble bee species [@Wood2019]. In shifting from the agronomic practices of the early 20th century to the more industrialized, intensive practices of the later 20th century, the habitat suitability for those previously favored bumble bees may have decreased paving way for the rise of those able to exploit the novel conditions.

## Conclusions
We provide the historical context of the extent and duration of bumble bee declines in a critical agricultural region of the US, further solidifying the evidence that agricultural intensification is a key driver of shifts in abundance and community composition over the last century. Over the last 130 years, agricultural intensification has elicited strong, selective pressures inadvertently choosing winners and losers in bumble bee communities. Our work supports an existing body of evidence, including recent, catastrophic declines in insect and arthropod abundance in agriculturally dominated landscapes [@Hallmann2017; @Seibold2019]. The combination of our historical analysis along with a growing body of observational and experimental evidence suggests that changes to agricultural practice and policies are required in order to limit additional declines of bumble bees in agricultural landscapes.

**Analysis filtering data to unique _species x location x collector x date_ combinations**

To determine whether sampling effort by individuals skewed the results of our analysis, we fit our primary model (`relative abundance ~ proportion cropland + number of crops + agricultural census year`; results shown in Fig. 3) to a reduced dataset, filtering records to include only unique combinations of species, location, collector, and collection date.  We found similar results in terms of the effect magnitude of predictors (proportion of cropland and number of crops), as well as the direction of the effect across study species (Fig. SA1.1).

**Analysis restricting to records within ± 2 years of agricultural census**

As agricultural census records are collected every 10 years, we were required to pair bumble bee records to the nearest agricultural census (a difference of up to ± 5 years).  This requirement might skew results if agricultural metrics display non-linear trends between census years.  TO determine if this was the case, we filtered records such that only bumble bee within ± 2 years of an agricultural census data were included.  Modeling these data resulted in broadly similar patterns of species relative abundance trends and response to proportion agriculture.  The response of species to number of crops showed the effect magnitude increase for some species, but the rank order of species responses was mostly similar (Fig. SA2.1).

**Raw changes in species relative abundance over time**

For each species, we calculated relative abundance for each temporal bin as the number of records of a given species divided by the total number of records for all species in that temporal bin. We then tested whether there was a statistically clear change in relative abundance over time by fitting generalized linear models with binomial error distributions for each species using time (i.e., temporal bin) as the sole predictor with each point weighted by the number of records [similar to @Bartomeus2013].

Of the 13 species included in our simple analysis of change in relative abundance over time, 6 saw statistically clear reductions in relative abundance: _B. borealis_, _B. fervidus_, _B. pensylvanicus_, _B. rufocinctus_, _B. terricola_, _B. vagans_ (Table S1). Similar to the patterns of estimated species richness, reductions in the relative abundance of these declining species seem to begin in the middle of the 20th century.  There were 7 species which increased in relative abundance over time period covered by this dataset: _B. affinis_, _B. auricomus_, _B. bimaculatus_, _B. citrinus_, _B. griseocollis_, _B. impatiens_, and _B. ternarius_.

**Table SA3.1:** Relative abundance estimates for each species across 8 time bins, sized in order to contain approximately equal numbers of bumble bee records per bin.  Coefficient estimates and p-values derived from models fit to estimate trends in relative abundance over time, where relative abundance of each species is predicted by time bin fit using a generalized linear model, with N records representing the number of records for a given species.
