## Abstract
The decline of North American bumble bees has been tentatively linked to changes in agricultural practices over the last century.  Researchers posit that a switch from the diverse and less intensive agricultural systems of the early 1900's to the largely monocultural, heavy-input systems of today has likely impacted both nesting habitat and floral resource availability with negative consequences for bumble bee populations and communities.  Despite several long-term analyses highlighting concerning population trends, no studies have yet explicitly linked metrics of agricultural intensification to bumble bee declines.  Using an extensive long term set of both bumble bee records and US agricultural census records, we show that metrics of increasing agricultural intensity are clearly associated with the decline of a 40% of bumble bee species in the US Midwest.  Additionally, we document several species increasing in relative abundance that positively associate with agricultural intensity, suggesting our agricultural practices have inadvertently selected winners and losers in the bumble bee community over the last century.  In addition to suggesting future avenues for controlled, manipulative experiments, our results suggest that changes to our agricultural practice and policies are required in order to limit additional declines of Midwestern bumble bees.

## Introduction
Extensive range contractions [@Kerr2015] and possible local extinctions [@Rasmont2012] of a number of bee species has sounded an alarm among entomologists and ecologists across the world [@Steffan-Dewenter2005c; @Tylianakis2013].  Of bee population trends that have been documented, bumble bees (Apidae: _Bombus_) are perhaps the most well-studied with reports of many species declining across Europe and North/South America [@Biesmeijer2006; @Colla2008; @Grixti2009; @Cameron2011; @Bartomeus2013; @Wood2019].  Owing to their importance as pollinators in both commercial crops [@Klein2007g] and natural systems [@Ollerton2011], understanding the factors driving bumble bee decline is critical.

A number of studies have posited mechanisms underpinning bumble bee declines, including climate change [@Kerr2015; @Marshall2017; @Sirois-Delisle2018], habitat loss [@Grixti2009; @Goulson2015c], the proliferation of parasites and disease [@Cameron2011, @McArt2017], and competition with managed bees [@Torne-Noguera2016; @Cane2017; @Mallinger2017a; @Ropars2019].  Among the potential drivers, the expansion and intensification of agriculture is consistently cited as a key factor in long-term declines of once common species in both the US [@Grixti2009; @Colla2008; @Jacobson2018a] and Europe [@Goulson2005b; @Carvell2006b].  A switch from the more diverse and less intensive agricultural systems of the early 1900's to the largely monocultural, heavy-input systems of today may lead to the loss of host plant species and habitat - a threat particularly salient to bumble bees unable to adapt to these changes [@Wood2019].

In the United States, analysis of museum records suggests that species declines began during periods of agricultural intensification in the mid 20th century [@Grixti2009].  Despite several long-term analyses highlighting concerning population trends, no studies have yet explicitly linked metrics of agricultural intensification or production to bumble bee declines due to a paucity of long-term data of both bumble bee occurrence and historical agricultural production, as well as the difficulty in assessing potential drivers experimentally.  Additionally, variable temporal patterns of species declines have been documented (e.g., long-term declines of European species [@Williams2007] vs. recent crash of _Bombus affinis_ Cresson in North America [@Giles2006], suggesting that the mechanisms driving declines may be species- and/or region-specific.  Moreover, some species appear stable, or may be increasing in both abundance and range [e.g., _Bombus impatiens_ Cresson: @Richardson2018; @Wood2019].

Several approaches have been employed to overcome data restrictions in order to understand the drivers of bumble bee decline, including experiments leveraging space-for-time substitution, as well as leveraging historical museum collections to understand species trends [@Bartomeus2019].  While unable to draw specific, causal connections, the use of historical data provides a unique perspective on temporal trends that even the most thorough experimental approaches cannot provide.  Several statistical approaches have been developed to account for the known biases of museum collection records, allowing new data sources to be implemented and leveraged in exploring bumble bee population trends [@Pearce2006; @Bartomeus2013; @Bartomeus2019].  The continued addition of museum collection records to repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) combined with extensive modern surveys of bumble bee fauna (e.g., Bumble Bee Watch) and data describing detailed agricultural production trends in the United States (Crossley et al. _in prep_) offer a unique opportunity to assess the agricultural factors associated with species population trends over time.

Testing specific proposed relationships of agricultural intensification to bumble bee species declines is paramount to creating targeted, evidence-based conservation efforts specific to threatened species.  To this end, we explore the relationships between bumble bee population trends and agricultural intensification in the north-central United States using an extensive data set of historical bumble bee museum records, modern citizen-science surveys, and agronomic metrics distilled from United States Census of Agriculture records.  Our results not only confirm existing long-term bumble bee population trends, but also describe clear associations among declines and selected proxies of agricultural intensification.  Together, our results suggest that alterations to our agricultural systems are essential if we hope to stem further loss of bumble bee species in our working landscapes.

## Methods
### Study region
In an effort to strengthen comparisons and analyses, we focused our study on the north-central US states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana as these states share a similar agricultural history.  We also limited our analysis to species whose core ranges overlapped these states to avoid range edge effects: _Bombus affinis_ Cresson, 1863; _Bombus impatiens_ Cresson, 1863; _Bombus griseocollis_ DeGeer, 1773; _Bombus bimaculatus_ Cresson, 1863; _Bombus auricomus_ Robertson, 1903; _Bombus ternarius_ Say, 1837; _Bombus vagans_ Smith, 1854; _Bombus borealis_ Kirby, 1837; _Bombus citrinus_ Smith, 1854; _Bombus pensylvanicus_ De Geer, 1773; _Bombus fervidus_ Fabricius, 1798; _Bombus rufocinctus_ Cresson, 1863; and _Bombus terricola_ Kirby, 1837.  Additionally, several bumble bee species known to be in decline nationally (including _B. affinis_, _B. terricola_ and _B. pensylvanicus_) have core historic ranges in the north-central US.

### Bumble bee specimen data
We obtained bumble bee records using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), querying for all records within our study region.  These data were combined with records from the North American Bumble Bee Watch program (www.bumblebeewatch.org) provided by the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.  We then filtered records to include only species known to occur within our study region and which were appropriately geo-referenced (longitude and latitude).  Each record was assigned to a county based on its collection coordinates.  Because 95% of records were from 1890 and beyond, we are confident that our county assignments are accurate as changes in county geographic extent were complete by 1890.

Temporal comparisons of museum and incidental records can be problematic due to collector/spatial bias and non-standardized collection techniques [@Bartomeus2013; @Richardson2018; @Bartomeus2019].  To account for this, we analyzed records using a variety of techniques to control for potential biases.  First, we filtered the dataset to include only single individual 'sampling events' (unique combination of species, date, location, and collector), following @Richardson2018.  All analyses were conducted using both the full and reduced datasets, but showed no difference in patterns.  We therefore present results from the full dataset.  For analyses comparing temporal trends in diversity, we created temporal bins of records such that there were approximately the same number of records per temporal bin, following @Bartomeus2013.  Bins were created using quantiles and the `rbin` package.  We created three binning strategies to determine if the number of bins affected our results [@Bartomeus2013], including a total of 3, 5 and 8 temporal bins.  Because trends were similar regardless of the number of bins, we present results from the 8-bin analyses.

### Historical agriculture data
To assess the extent, diversity, and intensity of agriculture, we used county-level agricultural census data [projected and geographically corrected by Crossley et al. _in prep_].  These records contain information about farm number and size, crop extent, yields, inputs, and expenses incurred by farms.  Our objective was to estimate county-level agricultural intensity, which includes aspects of both extensive and intensive farming practices.  Following Crossley et al., we limited our analysis to the 18 most extensive crops which together represent over 90% of agricultural products across our study region (Crossley et al. _in prep_). For each county by census year, we calculated crop richness and the proportion of county area in cropland as two measures of agricultural intensity (Fig. 6.1).

We also extracted other crops/aspects of farm management hypothesized to be associated with bumble bee reductions.  These included acreage of specific agricultural crops such as pasture and leguminous cover crops (e.g., red clover), as well as acreage treated with arthropod-targeting pesticides.  Because these variables were not available across the same temporal extent as crop richness and proportion of county in cropland, we conducted a separate analysis from 1974 onward where clover and pasture acreage, as well as pesticide treated acreage were available at the county level.

### Pairing bumble bee records with historical agriculture dataset
Because agricultural census data are collected every decade, not every bumble bee record was collected in a year concurrently with a census.  As such, we paired bumble bee records to the nearest year of agricultural census statistics (with a greatest difference between of 5 years).  While this may not perfectly reflect the state of agriculture in the county of record at a given time, we posit that it is still a meaningful pairing given that a difference of 2-5 years is not likely to manifest in large, county-level changes in agricultural practices.

### Calculating temporal patterns of abundance and diversity
To confirm the reports of decline in a number of bumble bee species in the US [@Grixti2009; @Bartomeus2013; @Richardson2018; @Jacobson2018a; @Wood2019], we first examined temporal trends in relative abundance and species diversity for our study region.  For each species, we calculated relative abundance for each temporal bin as the number of records of the species divided by the total number of records for all species in that temporal bin.  We then tested whether there was a statistically clear change in relative abundance by fitting generalized linear models for each species relative abundance time series with the temporal bin as the predictor, with each point weighted by the number of records [similar to @Bartomeus2013].

In order to estimate species richness changes over time, we rarefied records to generate estimates of mean species richness for each temporal bin with 95% CI using the `iNEXT` package [@Hsieh2016].  We then conducted a permutation test to determine if there was a statistically clear change in species richness over time [@Bartomeus2013].  Over 1000 permutations, we randomly shuffled the temporal bin order, calculating the correlation between bin and species richness estimates each permutation, with the p-value equalling the fraction of permuted correlations greater or less than the true chronological correlation value.

### Relating changes in relative abundance to agricultural intensity
We constructed models to determine whether changes in agricultural intensification were related to shifts in bumble bee relative abundance.  For each species, we fitted a generalized linear model with a binomial error structure to predict county-level relative abundance as a function of number of crops grown within a county, the proportion of county area in agriculture and the year of the agricultural census data associated with that bumble bee record to allow us to determine a temporal trend in species relative abundance taking into account agricultural intensification (Formula X).  Here, relative abundance was calculated for each county by agricultural census year combination rather than across equally sized temporal record bins used to determine general species trends.  This allowed us to examine more fine-scale changes in relative abundance over time associated with changes in agricultural practices.  Observations were weighted by the number of bumble bee records in a county by agricultural census year - effectively weighting counties that had greater sampling intensity and we felt were more likely to accurately describe species relative abundance at any given time.  Data were tested for spatial autocorrelation by first fitting data to generalized least squares models and then testing model residuals using a Moran's test [@Meehan2011; @Meehan2015].  To depict the estimated change relative abundance and range, we used our fitted models to predict relative abundance across historical ranges of each species within our study area using county-level agricultural intensification metrics.

Another series of models were constructed to test more detailed hypothesized drivers of bumble bee decline.  Generalized linear models with binomial errors were fit to predict county-level species relative abundance as a function of pasture acreage, acreage treated with arthropod-targeting insecticides, and the agricultural census year.  Because the agricultural census did not begin capturing pesticide input data until 1982, these models were fit on a subset of data from 1982 to present.

### Estimating change in county occupancy
Changes in relative abundance may not fully capture declines if species remain stable in occupied counties while the number of occupied counties decreases over time.  To account for changes in county-level occupancy (i.e., a proxy for range), we modeled the number of occupied counties per equal-record temporal bin for each study species using a generalized linear model, fitting number of counties as a function of time.

## Results
A total of 27,882 bumble bee occurrence records were compiled from GBIF and Bumble Bee Watch.  The species contained in each dataset were mutually inclusive.  We removed _Bombus fraternus_, _Bombus perplexus_, _Bombus ashtoni (bohemicus)_, and _Bombus variabilis_ from our analyses as all three species lacked sufficient records to make meaningful temporal interpretations of their relative proportions.  To analyze temporal shifts in relative abundance, these records were, based on their collection date, binned into 8 temporal bins, each with approximately 3400 records: 1824-1925, 1926-1950, 1951-1963, 1964-1969, 1970-1977, 1978-1996, 1997-2013, and 2014-present.  Of the 397 counties within the study region, 358 contained at least 1 bumble bee record.

### Changes in agricultural intensification
Agricultural cropland peaked in our region in 1950 (average of 45% ± 22% of county area).  Since then, it has decreased almost 10% to an average of 34% ± 20% (Fig. 6.1a, b).  Intensive agriculture has remained relatively sparse in the north of our study region, while the highest intensity occurs in the "corn belt" that stretches through southern Minnesota, Iowa, southern Wisconsin, central and northern Illinois, and northern Indiana.  Throughout the last century, the diversity of agricultural crops crown has decreased substantially (Fig. 6.1c, d).  Of the 18 crops we considered, an average of 12 ± 1 were grown from 1880 - 1950.  Since then, this number has been cut in half, with counties today growing on average 6 ± 1 crops.

### Changes in species richness and relative abundance
Rarefied species richness estimates for each temporal bin show estimated species richness declining 20% from 15 species in 1824-1925 to 12 species presently (Fig. 6.2) - a marginally significant negative trend (Permutation test: p = 0.059).  All eight temporal bin curves rapidly reached an asymptote, indicating that sample sizes were sufficient to capture the diversity of communities within each bin (Figure S6.1).

Of the 13 species included in our analyses, 5 saw statistically clear reductions in relative abundance (_B. fervidus_, _B. pensylvanicus_, _B. borealis_, _B. terricola_, _B. vagans_: Table 5.1).  Four species remained at similar proportions (_B. citrinus_, _B. auricomus_, _B. ternarius_, _B. rufocinctus_), while 4 increased in relative abundance over time (_B. affinis_, _B. bimaculatus_, and _B. impatiens_, and _B. griseocollis_).

### Relationships between agricultural intensification and relative abundance
Patterns in bumble bee relative abundance were clearly associated with trends in agricultural intensification metrics (Fig. 6.3, Table S6.1).  Species increasing in relative abundance over time tended to be associated with increased county-level proportion of agriculture as well as crop diversity (Fig. 6.3b,c).  Among species estimated to be in decline, county-level proportion of agriculture was negatively associated with relative abundance in all but two species, _B. griseocollis_ and _B. pensylvanicus_ (Fig. 6.3b).  The responses of species in decline to crop richness were mixed, with a majority increasing in relative abundance in accordance with crop richness.

All but three species showed declining trends in relative abundance, while three were found to not change over time (Fig. 6.4).  These estimates of temporal change in relative abundance modeled concurrently with metrics of agricultural intensity aligned well with changes estimated from generalized linear models fitted with time period as the sole predictor (Table 5.1 and Table S5.1).  One species, _B. griseocollis_, was shown to increase in relative abundance when modeled using time only, while marginally decrease when modeled with agricultural intensity metrics.  This difference is likely due to the weighting factors and effective sample size within each model.

We also found that more detailed agricultural metrics modeled from 1982 to present were clearly associated with patterns of relative abundance (Fig 6.3d, e, Table S6.2).  Pasture acreage had a consistently positive association with relative abundance (Fig. 6.3e), despite the fact that acres of pasture per county has decreased substantially over the last century.  Pesticide treated acres tended to be either negatively associated with, or unrelated to species relative abundance, except for three species (Fig 6.3e, _B. impatiens_, _B. affinis_, and _B. auricomus_).  These three species were also found to be positively or neutrally associated with proportion cropland.

### Changes in county occupancy
Overall, most species have increased in county occupancy over time (Fig. 6.5).  Notably, species of concern (_B. affinis_, _B. terricola_, and _B. pensylvanicus_) showed either a decrease in or no growth in county occupancy over time despite the increase in sampling effort that has occurred over the last few decades.

## Discussion
We have long posited that increases in agricultural intensity are a driving force behind bumble bee population declines.  Several experimental approaches have buttressed this proposed relationship, but studies explicitly tying long-term trends in agriculture to trends in bumble bee populations are still lacking.  Results from this study provide correlative support to this hypothesized relationship by examining agricultural growing practices and bumble bee records over 140 years and across 6 agronomically critical states within the US.  Our results confirm the alarming decline of a number of bumble bee species and provide support to the notion that that increases in agricultural intensity are a factor driving the decline of insects [@Hallmann2017; @Seibold2019] and other important taxa such as birds [@Benton2002; @Meehan2010a].

Of the 13 species in this study, 3 were found to increase, 3 remain at similar, and 7 to have declined in relative abundance.  Species in decline in our study match those found to be in decline elsewhere, including individual state analyses within our study region [@Grixti2009; @Wood2019], the US East coast [@Richardson2018; @Jacobson2018a], Canada [@Colla2008], and North America, generally [@Cameron2011; @Colla2012].  Those showing the most concerning patterns of decline include _B. terricola_ and _B. pensylvanicus_, both of which significantly decreased in relative abundance (both when measured by temporal bin analysis and with agricultural intensification metrics) as well as showed distinct decreases in county occupancy over time, having decreasing from peak occupancy between 1930-1950 to present (Figure 6.5).

A notable difference, however, is that we found no decline in the relative abundance of the federally endangered _B. affinis_ across our study region.  This result contradicts findings by almost all other longitudinal studies in which _B. affinis_ is considered.  In this case, presence-only relative abundance may not offer the best metric by which to judge species declines.  For example, if _B. affinis_ has been extirpated from a wide swath of its range [as is likely given evidence by @Colla2008; @Cameron2011; @Richardson2018; @Wood2019], but remained equally abundant in the localities it still occupies, presence-only relative abundance would not capture that change.  Accordingly, we examined the number of occupied counties over time, and see a distinct unimodal relationship for _B. affinis_, where peak county occupancy occurs in the mid 20th century, followed by a sharp decline until recently.  This recent increase in occupancy was recorded thanks to the efforts of the citizen science program Bumble Bee Watch.  County level occupancy may simple be a function of sampling effort, however sampling effort (as measured by total bees recorded per time period) remained at or above average following peak county occupancy in 1959.  Together, these results suggest that while _B. affinis_ has certainly declined in county occupancy within our study region, it may remain at similar or even increased relative abundance in the refuge counties that it still occupies.

We found that the intensification of agriculture through increases in crop land area and reduced diversity of crops was consistently associated with the patterns of bumble bee relative abundance.  With few exceptions, species whose relative abundance was found to be increasing or stable had either positive or neutral relationships with agricultural intensity metrics, while those in decline were negatively associated with increased agricultural intensity.  A notable exception is the increasingly common two-spotted bumble bee, _B. bimaculatus_, the only species predicted to be increasing in relative abundance that showed strong, a negative relationship with crop area but a strong, positive relationship with crop diversity.  _B. bimaculatus_ is known nest within woodlands and indeed favor early-emerging woodland plants [@Wood2019].  Cropland proportion is known to be negatively correlated to natural habitats such as woodland [@Brown2000; @Hemberger2018], and we find that counties that contain increased numbers of crops tend to be correlated with lower proportion cropland - a pattern that has emerged within the last 50 years.  Cropland has also decreased slightly in the last 80 years, having been replaced primarily by deciduous forest [@Rhemtulla2007a].  This change has potentially increased suitable habitat for _B. bimaculatus_.  We conclude that, while not as direct, the rise of _B. bimaculatus_ is still likely related to land use changes associated with agricultural intensification.

Another exception included the patterns of the declining _B. pensylvanicus_, which showed a strong, positive relationship with proportion of agriculture.  This is likely due to the fact that _B. pensylvanicus_ has historically been associated with agricultural landscapes containing open pasture and hayfields [@Franklin1913], areas likely to be within counties having a larger total proportion of agricultural area.  However, we did not find any relationship between _B. pensylvanicus_ and pasture acreage in our secondary analysis.  Together, this suggests that other agricultural practices, namely pesticide use or other aspects of agricultural land management, and/or pathogens [@Cameron2011] may be at play.  Indeed, we found a strong, negative relationship between _B. pensylvanicus_ relative abundance and pesticide treated acreage while controlling for the proportion of agricultural land and crop richness.

Generally, our analysis from 1982-present showed that increases in the acreage of cropland treated with pesticides tended to be associated with decreased relative abundance of all but three species which had no relationship (_B. rufocinctus_, _B. auricomus_, and _B. ternarius_).  The relative abundance of _B. rufocinctus_ and _B. ternarius_, however, was negatively impacted by proportion cropland, suggesting these species still are affected by large-scale agricultural intensification.  There is clear evidence that exposure to pesticides, including both insecticides and fungicides, is detrimental to bumble bee foraging [@Feltham2014], colony development [@Whitehorn2012; @Crall2018], and may also facilitate increased pathogen prevalence [@McArt2017].

We also found that pasture acreage was positively associated with bumble bee relative abundance for most species, while three showed no relationship.  Pastures and grasslands have been hypothesized to be a crucial source of floral habitat for foraging bumble bees both in the US and in Europe [@Carvell2006b] as it often contains plants in the family fabaceae, a preferred source of forage [@Goulson2005b].  While pastures and cover crops were used heavily in the early 20th century  to return nitrogen to soils, technological advancements following the second world war (namely artificial nitrogenous fertilizers) led quickly to the decline in these crops [@Williams1986; @Williams2009].

We suspect that reductions in suitable nesting and foraging habitat associated with agricultural intensification are the likely mechanisms underlying the observed relationships between bumble bees and agricultural intensification.  Increases in agricultural land have been implicated in the loss of diverse floral habitat such as tall-grass prairies [@Smith1998; @Brown2011], as well as large-scale reductions in bumble bee forage plants [@Carvell2006b].  A shift from the diverse cropping systems of the early to mid 1900's to largely monocultural systems in recent years has undoubtedly altered total floral resource availability and temporal continuity [@Schellhorn2015c] and has been shown to negatively impact bumble bee colony development [@Hass2018a].  While some mass-flowering crops might benefit bumble bee colony growth [@Westphal2009a], they may also favor species that can tolerate highly variable temporal resources [Schmid-Hempel1998a; Hemberger et al. in revision], and provide little dietary diversity for foraging bees.  Such a limit on pollen and nectar diversity may have adverse consequences for bumble bees [@Vaudo2015].  Additionally, landscapes that restrict floral resource availability during key time periods might limit bumble bee colony growth [@Williams2012b] and subsequent queen production [@Crone2016], thereby reducing population stability over time.

Any changes in floral resource composition brought about by agronomic practices (e.g., changing the number of identity of planted crops, or the control of weedy wildflower species) could also favor species with larger diet breadths [@Kleijn2008].  For example, species in the Pyrobombus subgenus are known to visit a greater diversity of floral resources, including a number of invasive weeds and agricultural crops [@Wood2019].  Such traits may allow this group to act as "agricultural utilizers" or "dwellers", while those declining (e.g., species in Bombus _sensu strictu_) might be considered "agricultural avoiders" [@Fischer2015] - unable to adapt to the novel conditions brought about by the rapid changes in plant diversity and abundance.

The largely positive response of relative abundance to crop richness suggests that increasing agricultural landscape heterogeneity could have benefits for both common and declining bumble bee species.  Increasing landscape heterogeneity is known to benefit a number of ecosystem services [@Fahrig2011b; @Turner2012] and biodiversity [@Benton2003], with relatively simple changes in cropland heterogeneity (e.g., decreasing field size).  Such changes could have even larger, positive effects on biodiversity than increasing the amount of semi-natural habitat in the landscape [@Sirami2019].  As natural habitats have becoming increasingly rare, alterations that we can make to our land use practices [e.g., @Landis2017] will be the key toward building multi-functional agroecosystems that both provide food and fiber for humans, as well as conserve essential ecosystem service providers and biodiversity writ large.

Museum records are an invaluable source of data for studies examining changes in species range and long term population trends [@Bartomeus2019], as well as understanding the ecological drivers that underpin changes in species assemblages over time [@Wood2019].  A strength of leveraging long-term museum records, including our approach in this study, include the ability to examine spatial and temporal scales that are not amenable to experimental methods [@Meehan2011].  However, care must be taken to account for biases associated with historical collections.  For example, museum collection records do not necessarily adhere to standard ecological practices of ensuring random, equal-effort samples over adequate space and time [@Richardson2018].  To account for known issues, we employed a variety of techniques including subsampling and sensitivity analyses to determine whether our chosen methods skewed results [for a thorough analysis of techniques to leverage historical collections, see @Bartomeus2019].  Irrespective of the approaches used, we consistently identified declines in over half of study species with clear associations to metrics of agricultural intensity.  We also caution against the over-interpretation of the correlative patterns observed in this study.  While the observed patterns offer evidence to further test mechanisms of decline, we stress that correlative approaches must be paired with manipulative experiments that can more explicitly test mechanisms over manageable spatial and temporal scales [e.g., understanding how human-mediated factors of bumble bee declines interface with bumble bee physiology: @Woodard2017a].

### Conclusions
By relating changes in county-level agricultural intensity to changes in the relative abundance of bumble bee species across the upper Midwest, we provide evidence that agricultural intensification is a key driver of shifts in bumble bee community composition and abundance over the last century.  Our work supports an existing body of evidence from both manipulative and observational studies, including recent, catastrophic declines documented in insect and arthropod abundance in agriculturally dominated landscapes. There is still a great need for additional experimentation to understand how land use drivers might interact with other known causes of bumble bee decline, namely climate change and pathogen and disease prevalence.  The combination of our results leveraging museum records and historical data along with a growing body of experimental evidence suggests that changes to our agricultural practice and policies are required in order to limit additional declines of Midwestern bumble bees.

Point colors are related to species relative abundance trend over time from 1880-present:  red points denote species whose relative abundance declined, black points denote no change in relative abundance, and blue points denote increases in relative abundance.
